**Simple Quiz Application in React**
This project is a simple quiz application built using React. 

The quiz dynamically displays questions and tracks the user's score as they progress. Key features include:

Timer for Each Question: Each question has a 10-second timer. If the user doesn't answer within the allotted time, the quiz automatically moves to the next question.

Real-Time Score Tracking: The user's score is updated in real-time, based on their correct answers.

Final Score Display: At the end of the quiz, the user's score is displayed along with an option to restart the quiz.

Dynamic Question Rendering: Questions and options are dynamically rendered from a JSON file, making it easy to update or expand the quiz content.

Key Concepts Utilized:
useState and useEffect hooks for managing state and side effects.
Conditional rendering for showing either the current question or the final score.
setInterval and clearInterval for implementing the countdown timer.
Event handling for processing user answers and resetting the quiz.
This project is a great starting point for anyone looking to learn React and understand how to build interactive web applications.
